            <p>
              When mysterious letters start arriving on his doorstep, Harry
              Potter has never heard of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
              Wizardry.
              <br>
              They are swiftly confiscated by his aunt and uncle.
              <br>
              Then, on Harry’s eleventh birthday, a strange man bursts in with
              some important news: Harry Potter is a wizard and has been awarded
              a place to study at Hogwarts.
              <br>
              And so the first of the Harry Potter adventures is set to begin.

            <p>
              Throughout the summer holidays after his first year at Hogwarts
              School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter has been receiving
              sinister warnings from a house-elf called Dobby.
              <br>
              Now, back at school to start his second year, Harry hears
              unintelligible whispers echoing through the corridors.
              <br>
              Before long the attacks begin: students are found as if turned to
              stone.
              <br>
              Dobby’s predictions seem to be coming true.

            <p>
              For Harry Potter, it’s the start of another far-from-ordinary year
              at Hogwarts when the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and
              comes to an abrupt halt in front of him.
              <br>
              It turns out that Sirius Black, mass-murderer and follower of Lord
              Voldemort, has escaped – and they say he is coming after Harry.
              <br>
              In his first Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of
              death in Harry’s tea leaves.
              <br>
              And perhaps most frightening of all are the Dementors patrolling
              the school grounds with their soul-sucking kiss – in search of
              fresh victims.

            <p>
              The rules of the Triwizard Tournament, which is about to take
              place at Hogwarts, only allow wizards over the age of seventeen to
              enter.
              <br>
              So Harry can only daydream about winning.
              <br>
              Then, to his surprise, on Hallowe’en when the Goblet of Fire makes
              its selection, his name is picked out of the magical cup.
              <br>
              Harry will face life-endangering tasks, dragons and Dark wizards.
              <br>
              He’ll have to rely on the help of his friends if he is to make it
              through the contest alive.

            <p>
              After the Dementors’ attack on his cousin Dudley, Harry knows he
              is about to become Voldemort’s next target.
              <br>
              Although many are denying the Dark Lord’s return, Harry is not
              alone, and a secret order is gathering at Grimmauld Place to fight
              against the Dark forces.
              <br>
              Meanwhile, Voldemort’s savage assaults on Harry’s mind are growing
              stronger every day.
              <br>
              He must allow Professor Snape to teach him to protect himself
              before he runs out of time.

            <p>
              One summer night, when Dumbledore arrives at Privet Drive to
              collect Harry Potter, his wand hand is blackened and shrivelled,
              but he will not reveal why.
              <br>
              Rumours and suspicion spread through the wizarding world – it
              feels as if even Hogwarts itself might be under threat.
              <br>
              Harry is convinced that Malfoy bears the Dark Mark: could there be
              a Death Eater amongst them?
              <br>
              He will need powerful magic and true friends as, with the help of
              Dumbledore, he investigates Voldemort’s darkest secrets.

            <p>
              Harry Potter is leaving Privet Drive for the last time. But as he
              climbs into the sidecar of Hagrid’s motorbike and they take to the
              skies, he knows Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters will not be
              far behind.
              <br>
              The protective charm that has kept him safe until now is broken.
              But the Dark Lord is breathing fear into everything he loves. And
              he knows he can’t keep hiding.
              <br>
              To stop Voldemort, Harry knows he must find the remaining
              Horcruxes and destroy them.
              <br>
              He will have to face his enemy in one final battle.

            <p>
              Being Harry Potter has never been easy. And it isn’t much easier
              now, as we catch up with him nineteen years after the Battle of
              Hogwarts.
              <br>
              These days, Harry is a husband, father of three school-age
              children, and an overworked employee at the Ministry of Magic.
              <br>
              While he struggles with a personal history that refuses to stay in
              the past, his youngest son Albus must grapple with the weight of
              the family legacy he never asked for.
              <br>
              As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the
              uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected
              places.
              <br>
              Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the Harry
              Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be
              presented on stage.
              <br>
              Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany and
              Jack Thorne, the play was scripted by Jack and directed by John.
              <br>
              It received its world premiere in London’s West End on 30 July
              2016.
